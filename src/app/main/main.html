        DMNs are designed to answer questions related to the given stories. 
        They are trained on datasets of lots of stories and questions. 
        All available models here are pretrained on Facebook's 
        <a href="http://fb.ai/babi" target="_blank">bAbI tasks</a>. 
        The vocabulary is quite limited but it is enough to describe various reasoning tasks.
